# Laravel React Typescript boilerplate

## About Laravel

This is a Laravel 7.0 application setup to run pages in React and Typescript.

## Requirements

This is my current setup:

- PHP 7.2.5
- Node 11.13.0
- Yarn 1.22.4

Laravel has its own set of requirements [here](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation)

## Installation

Clone this repository in your local environment.

```
$ mkdir project
$ git clone https://github.com/kedomingo/lara-react-ts.git .

$ composer install
$ yarn install

```

Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ it should show the message Hello World rendered by the `Text.tsx` component, and attached to the `App.tsx` component
